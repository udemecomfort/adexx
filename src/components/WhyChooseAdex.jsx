        <p>
          At Adex Driving School, our mission is simple: to empower individuals
          with the skills, knowledge, and confidence to drive safely and
          responsibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe learning to drive is more than just passing a test — it’s
          about building lifelong habits that promote safety, responsibility,
          and self-assurance on the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach combines professionalism, patience, and personalized
          instruction in a supportive environment where every student feels
          valued and respected. Whether you're just starting out or returning to
          driving after a break, we’re here to guide you with care and
          expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          With certified instructors, modern dual-control vehicles, and a
          commitment to excellence, we help our students become thoughtful,
          defensive drivers — ready for the road ahead.
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold">
          At Adex, we don’t just teach driving. We build confident drivers for
          life.
